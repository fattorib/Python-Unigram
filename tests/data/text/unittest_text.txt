Unigram is a subword tokenization algorithm introduced in Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation Models with Multiple Subword Candidates (Kudo, 2018). In contrast to BPE or WordPiece, Unigram initializes its base vocabulary to a large number of symbols and progressively trims down each symbol to obtain a smaller vocabulary. The base vocabulary could for instance correspond to all pre-tokenized words and the most common substrings. Unigram is not used directly for any of the models in the transformers, but itâ€™s used in conjunction with SentencePiece.
